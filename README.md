## How to update this project in Eclipse

I will add examples here as I prepare for lectures throughout the Fall. When you import this repository, you will not have all the things I haven't built yet, but we can ask Eclipse to download my changes!

Right-Click on this project in Eclipse, then go to "Team" and choose "Pull" (close to top).

This should be all you need! If, for some reason, you and I have edited the same files, I can help you through the steps of either resetting your file ***or*** you can import a new copy of this repository.
